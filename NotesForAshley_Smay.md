Problem 1 I did my best to get it to look as close as possible to the example. When it made the graph my STO was much smaller than the example but I lloked to see what unit it was and it said STO(thrust) wasnt sure what that meant.
Problem 2 I used smays Polymer stem, I could not get a value to come out of the center of mass and all the other values were way off but I had to call it because I already spent way too much time on this problem.
Problem 3 I used smays stem codes for the quarter car model. After multiple attempts i had to just call it. The code does run and will calculate and optimize the position vs time graph but when i hit the tab to switch to Force vs Time it crashes. I couldnt figure out why but this was my best attempt at the problem so I submitted it.
Problem 4
