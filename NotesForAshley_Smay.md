Problem 1 I did my best to get it to look as close as possible to the example. When it made the graph my STO was much smaller than the example but I lloked to see what unit it was and it said STO(thrust) wasnt sure what that meant.
Problem 2 I could not get a value to come out of the center of mass and all the other values were way off but I had to call it because I already spent way too much time on this problem.
Problem 3
