Problem 1 I did my best to get it to look as close as possible to the example. When it made the graph my STO was much smaller than the example but I lloked to see what unit it was and it said STO(thrust) wasnt sure what that meant.

Problem 2 I used smays Polymer stem, I could not get a value to come out of the center of mass and all the other values were way off but I had to call it because I already spent way too much time on this problem.

Problem 3 I used smays stem codes for the quarter car model. After multiple attempts i had to just call it. The code does run and will calculate and optimize the position vs time graph but when i hit the tab to switch to Force vs Time it crashes. I couldnt figure out why but this was my best attempt at the problem so I submitted it.

Problem 4 Ran the Gui I chose the option for dual but it kept crashing after that. This test is taking more time than I have so im gonna have to take what I can get.

Thank you Ashley and Smay for a great semester, I appreciate how this class was taught and how yall gave us your time outside of the class to help with any questions. Coding is a difficult thing to just jump into, starting from zero i learned a lot even though I needed Chatgpt to really guide me through and fix a million little details like capital letters.
